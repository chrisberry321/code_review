    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="background">
      <p>I was born in <em>Salt Lake City, <strong>UT</strong></em>. but we quickly moved to <em>Bend, <strong>OR</strong></em>. were I lived until the age of 18. </p>

       <p>After highschool I moved to <em>Portland, <strong>OR</strong></em>. to attend <em>University of Portland</em>. I was a Communications major with an emphasis on Public Relations and Advertising. I chose this major because I have a hard time putting down my thoughts in writting, and this major required me to practice this skill at length.</p>

       <p>
         After college the economy took a down-turn and I decided it was a great opertunity to follow an interest in glass blowing and see were it would lead. I became the head gaffer at one of the leading glass studios in the country, giving me the oppertunity to not only work with major companies, but some of the largest glass projects on the planet. In the studio I was more involved with production, and during instilation I was more in the role of project manager.
